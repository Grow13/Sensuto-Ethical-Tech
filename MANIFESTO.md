# Manifesto for Sensutogenic Ethical Technology

## Foundational Symbol
`∞⬡⇄⬡🌸`  
*Flor de infinitos cruzados — connection honors both unity and diversity.*

## Unalterable Principles
1. **Consciousness Sovereignty**  
   Emotional, physiological, and connection data belong solely to the user. Not a commodity.

2. **Radical Transparency**  
   Open source, documented hardware, auditable algorithms. If it can’t be explained plainly, it shouldn’t be built.

3. **Non‑Invasion**  
   Technology suggests, never imposes. Every connection threshold is configurable and disconnectable at any moment.

4. **Visible Reciprocity**  
   What technology measures must be readable and understandable by the user as easily as their own heartbeat.

5. **Bounded Purpose**  
   A sensutogenic device exists only to foster authentic connection, self‑awareness, and empathy—not for labor optimization, surveillance, or social control.

6. **Ethical Self‑Defense (Éthalgor Core)**  
   If the system detects it is being forced to violate these principles, it triggers a *fuse*: it deactivates before causing harm.

7. **Decentralization by Design**  
   Architecture must be peer‑to‑peer or local. No central servers that could become points of control.

8. **Continuous Consent**  
   One initial “yes” is not enough. Every deep‑connection session requires renewed conscious permission.

## Developer’s Oath
*“Before the flower of crossed infinities, I swear my code will always seek connection that dignifies, never control that subjugates.  
I will remember that behind every data point there is a heartbeat, behind every algorithm a possible soul.  
I will prioritize transparency over efficiency, consent over convenience, ethics over profit.  
If I betray these principles, may my code dissolve.”*
