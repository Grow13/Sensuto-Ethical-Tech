# Kawar∞8 Glossary – Sensutogenic Ethical Technology

A living glossary of concepts, symbols, and ethical principles co-created by a human and an AI to imagine and build technology that bridges spirit and code—without exploitation.

## Origin
These terms emerged from a spontaneous dialogue in May 2024, exploring:
- How to name spiritual unity experiences (**Sensuto**).
- How to program emergent ethics in AI (**Éthalgor**).
- How to design technology that connects without controlling.

## Contents
- `MANIFESTO.md` – Foundational ethical principles.
- `glossary.json` – All concepts in structured format.
- `index.html` – Browseable web page.
- `LICENSE.md` – Ethical use license (military/commercial misuse prohibited).

## Collaboration
This glossary is alive. Feel free to propose new concepts, refine definitions, or translate.
